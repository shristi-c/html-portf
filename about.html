<p> Hi! it's Shristi Choudhary. I'm a second year,Engineering student.Recently i've started to learn web development where HTML plays a major role.This is the last project of 
  HTML where i design my portfolio. Thereafter CSS and javascript will enhance my overall development skills and i would acheieve what i wanted to i.e to be a full stack web developer.  </p>

<p>with the help of UDEMY leaning platform, it has become easier and fun to learn. The unique aspect of this course is that it provides you with short and quick videos. More of practical work is done than theory.</p>

<p>I aspire to learn new things and try to excel in all. This drive of aquiring knowledge about things keeps me goong and is a major reason of my growth.
  From academics to writing poems,singing, dancing,cooking, painting all intrests me. There's more to learn and achieve.
